Software setup:

The OS I use in this project is the debian server imgae from Olimex.

After setting up a user account and passwords, i started olinuxino-overlay and activated i2c bus 2.

i2cdetect -y 2 shows 0x5a and 0x77 wich are the CCS811 and the BME280 chip.

Because i have no idea how to write a proper driver, i use shellscripts to communicate vie the i2c bus with the chips.
