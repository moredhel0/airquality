Software setup:

The OS I use in this project is the debian server imgae from Olimex.

After setting up a user account and passwords, i started olinuxino-overlay and activated i2c bus 2.

i2cdetect -y 2 shows 0x5a and 0x77 wich are the CCS811 and the BME280 chip.

Because i have no idea how to write a proper driver, i use shellscripts to communicate vie the i2c bus with the chips.
For communication with the rest of the software I created a directory /var/measurment and madre it readable and writable for everyone.
The start-sensors.sh script has to run after every start to activate the chips. The read-trim.sh script has to run once to get the trimming factors encoded in the chip.
Everytime read-hum-press-temp.sh and read-co2-org.sh are called, the current values ale read from the chips.

preserve-values.sh is used to save the last 100 sensor values via a cronjob.

Gnuplot is used to generate png files

I am using apache2 as web server.

To run the script sbcl has to be installed.
