measuring the indoor air quality

In this repo i am saving the software i made to monitor the air quality using a olinuxino a20 https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/A20/A20-OLinuXino-MICRO/open-source-hardware and the mod-env https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/Sensors/MOD-ENV/open-source-hardware sensor connected to the first UEXT port of the olinuxino.
